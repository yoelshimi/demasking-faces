File explanation:

**who-is-behind-the-mask.ipynb** - This is the notebook for loading data, training the model and testing (with sharpening).

**image sharpening.txt** - File with link to article of image sharpening we used.

**face generator examples and comments.ipynb** - Another version of code, includes extra features we added such as the VGG - 16 network as a quality - of - image metric and losses we experimented with.

**VGG16_discriminator.ipynb** - A notebook with only the code for quality - of - image metric testing.
